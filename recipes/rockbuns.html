            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p><strong><em>KINDLY USE A MEASURING CUP & SPOON FOR THIS</em></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 cups of all purpose flour</li> 
                <li>1 cup of sugar</li> 
                <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder</li> 
                <li>2 teaspoons of nutmeg</li> 
                <li>1 to 1Â¼ cup of butter</li> 
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>2 cups of fresh milk</li> 
                <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla essence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix together all the dry ingredients - flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the butter to the dry ingredients mixture. Mix thoroughly until the mixture becomes very flaky and rough, resembling breadcrumbs. This step is crucial for achieving the proper texture - if not done correctly, the rock buns will not taste as good as they should.</li>
                <li>You can either add the wet ingredients directly or mix the eggs and milk together separately before adding. Add the three eggs, two cups of fresh milk, and vanilla essence to the mixture. The chef emphasizes using fresh milk rather than water as it makes the rock buns taste better.</li>
                <li>Give the mixture a good mix, but be careful not to over-mix it. This is key to achieving that rough texture characteristic of rock buns. The mixture should remain somewhat rough and not be completely smooth.</li>
                <li>Grease your cupcake molds or baking tins. Using your hands (preferred method) or a spoon, tear portions of the batter and place them into the greased cupcake molds. If you don't have cupcake molds, you can place portions on a flat baking surface, though cupcake molds give the perfect shape.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven according to your oven type. Bake the rock buns for 30 minutes. To check if they're done, pierce with a stick or toothpick - if it comes out clean and not wet, they're ready. If still wet inside, return to the oven and continue baking until fully cooked.</li>
