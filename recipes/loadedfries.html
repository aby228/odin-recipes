    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create the seasoning mix by combining ginger powder, garlic powder, bay leaf powder, all-purpose seasoning, chili pepper (or red pepper), and parsley flakes.</li>
        <li>Make the loaded fries sauce by mixing mayonnaise, ketchup, hot sauce (or red chili sauce), mustard, kebab pepper, and parsley flakes. Use good quality condiments for best results.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken breast with the prepared seasoning mix and add oil to keep it moist and juicy.</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken for 20-25 minutes (chicken breast doesn't need long marination).</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken in a pan with oil until done to your taste, or grill it in an air fryer.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a saucepan and add onions for flavor.</li>
        <li>Add minced beef to the pan along with some of the seasoning mix and kebab pepper for spicy flavor.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry the minced meat until it's well-cooked, soft, and juicy.</li>
        <li>Deep fry the potato chips rather than shallow frying to prevent them from becoming too soft or burning quickly.</li>
        <li>Season the fried potatoes with parsley flakes and salt (salt is optional).</li>
        <li>Place the fried potatoes on your serving plate or bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer with cheese to help it melt when microwaved.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken and minced beef on top of the fries.</li>
        <li>Generously apply the prepared sauce over the meat.</li>
        <li>Add more mustard if desired (honey mustard adds nice honey flavor).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle parsley flakes throughout (described as a "star ingredient").</li>
        <li>Top with more cheese if you want it extra cheesy (optional).</li>
        <li>Microwave for 1-3 minutes to melt the cheese.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final sprinkle of parsley flakes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
