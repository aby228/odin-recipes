            <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
            
            <h3>Tomato Mix Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Roast the vegetables:</strong> Place 5 tomatoes, 4 large red bell peppers, 14-16 red chilies, 1 onion, 1 carrot, fresh basil, and fresh coriander on a grill or roast them. The chef emphasizes roasting because "it makes it very very nice gives it this Smokey flavor".</li>
                <li><strong>Blend the mixture:</strong> After roasting, blend all the roasted vegetables in a blender with some water until you get a smooth tomato mix.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Stew Base Mix Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the base ingredients:</strong> Combine 15-17 pieces of kpakposhito, 2 large bell peppers (green or yellow), ginger, 8 pieces of garlic, 1 large carrot, 1 large onion, bay leaf, rosemary, and fresh dill (optional).</li>
                <li><strong>Blend with oil:</strong> Blend all these ingredients together, adding some oil and water to make the mixture smooth. The chef notes this mix "can be used to steam your meats or your goats or any protein you're using for your jollof".</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Meat Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Season the meat:</strong> Use the same stew base mix to season your goat meat or other protein, adding seasoning and water to build flavors and create stock for the jollof.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Making the Stew</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start with oil:</strong> Add a generous amount of oil to your pot - "jollof needs a lot of oil so don't be scared to pour".</li>
                <li><strong>Fry onions and peppers:</strong> Add onions and peppers to the oil and fry them well before adding your base mix.</li>
                <li><strong>Add the base mix:</strong> Add your blended stew base mix and fry it thoroughly. The chef emphasizes: "you need to fry this very well before you add in your tomato mix".</li>
                <li><strong>Add tomato paste:</strong> For a red jollof, add plenty of tomato paste and fry it with the oil and pepper mix until it's well cooked and "opening up". The chef notes that "jollof is about tomato paste and the bell peppers" for achieving the red color.</li>
                <li><strong>Add tomato mix:</strong> Pour in your blended tomato mix and stir consistently to prevent burning. Cover and let the stew cook.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Spice Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mix spices:</strong> Combine your spice mix including Miss Cookie Stew Mix, white pepper, black pepper, jollof seasoning, chicken seasoning, goat seasoning, seasoning cube, Kivo curry powder, and smoked paprika. The chef stresses that "if you don't get a good spice mix for your jollof my dear it won't be nice".</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Cooking the Rice</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Add rice:</strong> Use good quality rice (the chef uses Lily rice) and add it to the stew, ensuring there's a proper balance between rice and stew.</li>
                <li><strong>Use stock, not water:</strong> Add the stock from cooking your meat instead of water. The stock builds up the jollof's flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook with steam:</strong> Cover the pot and let the jollof cook with steam. The chef explains that "jollof doesn't cook with water it cooks with steam".</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal stirring:</strong> Stir the jollof no more than three times during cooking to prevent breaking the rice. "You need to give the jollof freedom of justice let the jollof take his time to cook".</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Final Touches</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Add finishing ingredients:</strong> Near the end of cooking, add butter, vegetables (optional), and your cooked goat meat.</li>
                <li><strong>Let it finish cooking:</strong> Allow the jollof to complete cooking with all ingredients combined.</li>
            </ol>
